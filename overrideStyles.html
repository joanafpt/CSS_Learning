<!--Override Styles in Subsequent CSS Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element. However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section are what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text -->
 

    <style>
        body {
          background-color: black;
          font-family: monospace;
          color: green;
        }
        .pink-text {
          color: pink;
        }
      
        .blue-text{
          color: blue;
        }
      </style>
      <h1 class="pink-text blue-text">Hello World!</h1>

      <!-- output is "Hello World" with blue color-->
